    <p>To celebrate Pokemon Go's upcoming release of a new batch of creature to seek out, its third since launch, let's take a look at the very first generation to be released, both in Pokemon Go and in the larger Pokemon World: the original generation of 151 Pokemon!</p>
    <img src='img/001.png'>
    <p>One of the charms of collecting Pokemon is that the species are not only cute (usually), but also unique. The uniqueness <br>of each species is determined by just three stats--Attack, Defense, and HP--and one or two elemental types.</p>
    <img src='img/025.png'>
    <p>However, that limited number of options is enough to produce all the variations found in Pokemon Go. <br>It causes some creatures to be heavily favored over others. Keep reading to find out more!</p>

      <div>In Pokemon Go, Pokemon have three major stats: Attack, Defense, and HP. Currently, this graph is plotting Pokemon's attack against their defense.</div>
      <!-- 1 -->
      <div>There are four noticeable outliers. We'll look at the psychic Pokemon on the far right and the water Pokemon on the far left a little later. The other two Pokemon are Onix to the left and Cloyster to the right. Both of them have extremely high defenses of 288 and 323 respectively. In a fight where you want someone beefy to tank hits, one of these two would be your choice. Cloyster hits significantly harder though.</div>
      <!-- 2 -->
      <div>Swapping attack for HP now pulls Onix and Cloyster lower into the pack. However, a new Pokemon jumps straight out of the group: Chansey, with a whopping 500 health. Though it might not shine in attack and has a mediocre defense, Chansey makes a great defender because of the way Pokemon Go gyms work: Pokemon get their health doubled while defending in a gym.</div>
      <!-- 3 -->
      <div>While Cloyster still has twice the defense of Chansey, Chansey makes up for it with five times more health: an 800 HP difference! The three Pokemon with the closest health values--Snorlax, Wigglytuff, and Vaporeon--would also make decent defenders and pack a little more attack, as the next transition show.</div>
      <!-- 4 -->
      <div>Note that plotting HP and attack once again pull the psychic Pokemon to the far right and the water Pokemon to the far left. These are Mewtwo and Magikarp, respectively.</div>
      <div>Mewtwo, the artificially cloned Pokemon featured in the first Pokemon movie, is the strongest creature in the first generation and Magikarp, a fish that can do absolutely no damage in other Pokemon games, is the weakest by far. The difference will become especially clear when plotted for CP.</div>
      <!-- 5 -->
      <div>This can be 
      <div>Of course, in the end, the best Pokemon is whichever Pokemon you like the most! The numbers and stats here may help you in eking out the toughest battles, but the current battle system in Pokemon Go makes it possible for almost any Pokemon to contribute to a fight. Further updates may introduce new stats or abilities to elevate weaker Pokemon as well! In the graph below, you can adjust the factors for yourself to look for more patterns.</div>
